</head>
<body>

<p> It doesn't start with "!DOCTYPE html", the body tag should be after the head tag not inside it, there is no title tag inside of head, and there isn't a wrap tag on "Will I be seen?".</p>

<p>"Will I be seen?" will be seen in the browser even though it is not wrapped in a tag because it is in the body and the browser will probably think you just forgot it.
